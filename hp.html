Hardwood is wood from dicot angiosperm trees. The term may also be used for the trees from which the wood is derived; these are usually broad-leaved temperate and tropical forests. In temperate and boreal latitudes they are mostly deciduous, but in tropics and subtropics mostly evergreen. Hardwood contrasts with softwood (which is from gymnosperm trees).
Hardwood should not be confused with the term "heartwood", which can be from hardwood or softwood.
Hardwoods are produced by angiosperm trees that reproduce by flowers, and have broad leaves.
